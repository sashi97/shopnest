## Prerequisites

1. Python 3.7 or higher
2. MySQL Server 8.0 or higher
3. Power BI Desktop (for viewing and modifying dashboards)

## Required Python Packages

```
pandas
sqlalchemy
pymysql
```

## Setup Instructions

1. **Install Required Python Packages**
   ```bash
   pip install pandas sqlalchemy pymysql
   ```

2. **MySQL Setup**
   - Install MySQL Server if not already installed
   - Create a new database named 'shop_nest':
     ```sql
     CREATE DATABASE shop_nest;
     ```
   - Note your MySQL credentials (username and password)

3. **Configure Database Connection**
   - Open `upload_csv_to_mysql.py`
   - Update the following variables with your MySQL credentials:
     ```python
     db_user = 'root'  # Replace with your MySQL username
     db_pass = 'password'  # Replace with your MySQL password
     db_host = 'localhost'  # Update if your MySQL is on a different host
     db_name = 'shop_nest'
     ```
   - Update the `csv_folder_path` variable to point to the directory containing your CSV files

4. **Data Import**
   - Place all CSV files in the same directory
   - Run the upload script:
     ```bash
     python upload_csv_to_mysql.py
     ```
   - The script will automatically create tables and import data from all CSV files

5. **Power BI Dashboard**
   - Open `Shop Nest store.pbix` with Power BI Desktop
   - Update the data source connection to point to your MySQL database
   - Refresh the data to see the latest information
